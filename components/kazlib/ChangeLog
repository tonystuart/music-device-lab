2012-05-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* docs.ltx: Added missing documentation for dict_merge and
	dict_similar. Documented all of the C++ additions of the previous
	commit.

2012-05-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Exposing the remaining dict API via the C++ interface.

	* dict.h (kazlib::load_suport, kazlib::no_load_support): New feature
	expression classes.
	(kazlib::dict_dfl_feat): New typedef member, load_t, establishing that
	the default feature is not to support loading.
	(kazlib::trait_combinator<load_support, REST>): New trait combinator
	for adding load support.
	(kazlib::trait_combinator<no_load_support, REST>): New trait combinator
	for adding load support.
	(kazlib::dict::load_ctx): New class member. Type is empty class
	if the dict has no load support, and so takes no space.
	In this case, use of the load_begin/load_next/load_end functions
	will not compile.
	(kazlib::dict::strict_upper_bound, kazlib::dict::strict_lower_bound,
	kazlib::dict::isempty, kazlib::dict::isfull, kazlib::dict::contains):
	New functions.
	(kazlib::dict::process_func): New static member function.
	(kazlib::dict::process): New template member function.
	(kazlib::dict::load_begin, kazlib::dict::load_next,
	kazlib::dict::load_end, kazlib::dict::merge): New member functions.

	* tests/dict-1.cc (print): New function, friend to person class.
	(main): by_id dictionary declared with load_support.
	Dict functions load_begin, load_next and load_end are used
	to load the items in order. The process member function is
	used to print the contents of by_first_name.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile.gcc: Use --whole-archive to link the static library contents
	properly into the shared library.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile.gcc: $($(DLIB)) Fix -soname.
	(install): Use macros instead of hard-coded library names.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* docs.ltx: Bump release and date.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile.gcc: integrating patches from Debian maintainer
	Bálint Réczey, in slightly different ways. A static and
	shared library is now built, and there is an install target.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* tests/dict-1.cc: Declare objects in an array. This exercises the
	copy constructor of dnode, and eliminates duplicate code.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile.gcc: Revamped to take advantage of various GNU Make
	tricks. Builds new C++ test case, which is taken from the LaTeX doc.

	* tests/dict-1.cc: New file.

2012-05-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* Makefile.gcc (CFLAGS): Dropping -pedantic, adding -W.

	* dict.c (free_nodes): Unused static function removed.
	(dnode_alloc, dnode_free, new_node, del_node): Added casts
	of unused arguments to void to suppress unused variable warning.

	* docs.ltx: Revised out of date section about what C++ identifiers are
	exposed by dict.h. Fixed typo.

	* except.c (bottom_level): Fixed waring about return value from
	fgets being ignored.
	(main): Switched to no-arguments main since argc and argv were
	not used.

	* hash.c (hnode_alloc, hnode_free, new_node): Added casts
	of unused arguments to void to suppress unused variable warning.

	* sfx.c (CONTEXT_T_INIT): New macro.
	(chk_cast): Use CONTEXT_T_INIT macro to initialize variables
	of type context_t.

2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@gmail.com>

	Terminology change. The alloc traits should use item
	and not node terminology, since destruction is applied
	to items, not dnodes.

	* dict.h (kazlib::static_nodes): Renamed to static_items.
	(kazlib::dynamic_nodes): Renamed to dynamic_items.
	(kazlib::placement_nodes): Renamed to placement_items.
	(kazlib::dict_dfl_feat, kazlib::alloc_feature): Declarations updated.
	(kazlib::trait_combinator<>): Partial specializations updated.

	* docs.ltx: Updated.


2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* dict.c (dict_clear): Reverts back to internal linkage.

	* dict.h (dict_clear): Declaration removed.
	(kazlib::dict_base, kazlib::dict_bdbk, kazlib::dict_bdmk,
	kazlib::dict_mdbk, kazlib::dict_mkmk): Template classes removed.

	* docs.ltx: Revamped documentation of C++ utilities for dict,
	from the perspective of the trait combination paradigm.
	The base class is now just dict.


2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Added a new function safe_traverse, which performs an iterative
	bottom-up traversal rather than a recursive one.
	
	dict_free_nodes retargetted to use this function.
	
	dict_clear exposed as external function.

	* dict.c (safe_traverse): New function.
	(dict_free_nodes): Use safe_traverse.
	(dict_init_alloc): New function for one step initialization
	with custom allocator functions.
	(dict_clear): Changed from internal to external linkage.
	
	* dict.h (dict_init_alloc, dict_clear): Declared.

2009-11-12  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* docs.ltx: Condense index.  Do not list every function under the
	functions category in the index; they are all in the main index.

2009-11-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	The dnode class must support assignment and copy construction.

	* dict.h (kazlib::dnode): Copy constructor and assignment operator
	added.

	* docs.ltx: Documented these functions and added index entries.

2009-11-10  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* docs.ltx: Added remarks to first C++ example that the comparison
	function is not strictly needed.  Added new file sorting example for
	dict_bdbk.

2009-11-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	* docs.ltx: Fix issues in C++ example. The allow dupes was not turned
	on, so the example would have blown up on duplicate first or last names.

2009-11-09  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	New C++ utilities in dict.h.
	Documented in docs.ltx.
	Tabs eliminated from docs.ltx.

	* dict.h: If __cplusplus is defined, include the <functional> header.
	(kazlib::dnode, kazlib::dict_base, kazlib::dnode_is_member,
	kazlib::key_is_member, kazlib::compare_with_function,
	kazlib::dnode_is_base, kazlib::key_is_base, kazlib::dict,
	kazlib::dict_bdbk, kazlib::dict_bdmk, kazlib::dict_mdbk,
	kazlib::dict_mkmk): New template classes.
	(kazlib::default_compare): New template function.

	* docs.ltx: Updated to clarify that Kazlib is also a C++ library.
	New index entries. Documented new C++ utilities.

2009-11-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	Use dict_init in dict_create instead of repeated code.
	All code compiles as C++ now.

	* dict.c (dict_create): Use dict_init. Cast added to
	return value of malloc.
	(dict_init_like): Parameter template renamed to orig. This is
	because template is a C++ keyword.
	(dict_delete): Parameter delete renamed to target, because
	delete is a C++ keyword.
	(dnode_alloc): Cast added to return value of malloc.
	(dict_load_end): Some casts added where enum members are computed
	values. C++ type safety of enumerations doesn't allow the
	direct assignment.
	(comparef): Added casts from const void * to const char *.
	(dupstring): malloc cast.
	(main): Casts on dnode_get.

	* except.c (except_throwf): Cast on except_alloc.
	(top_level): Cast added when passing string literal to
	except_cleanup_push because const char * doesn't convert
	to void *.
	(main): Local variable catch renamed to match to avoid
	clash with C++ keyword.

	* hash.c (grow_table, shrink_table): Cast on return value of
	realloc.
	(hash_create, hnode_alloc, hnode_create): Caston return value of malloc.
	(hash_fun_default, hash_comp_default): Casts from void * to
	character pointers.
	(tokenize): Added casts from const void * to const char *.
	(dupstring): malloc cast.
	(main): Casts on hnode_get.

	* list.c (list_create): Cast on malloc. Avoid C++ keyword new.
	(lnode_pool_create): Cast on malloc.
	(list_ins_after, list_ins_before, lnode_borrow): Avoid C++ keyword new.
	(tokenize): Added casts from const void * to const char *.
	(dupstring): malloc cast.
	(main): Casts on lnode_get.

	* sfx.c (speculate, sfx_determine): Variable catch renamed to match.
	(lookup_cache): Cast on hnode_get return value.
	(cache_result): Cast on hnode_get and malloc.

	Trailing whitespace removed. Some reformatting of text.

2009-11-08  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>

	New functions.
	(main): < and > commands added for exercising new functions.

	* dict.h (dict_strict_lower_bound, disc_strict_upper_bound):
	Declared.  

	* docs.ltx: Documentation updated.

2009-11-06  Kaz Kylheku  <kaz@kylheku.com>
